# HitSpeedTest

Translated to English with DeepL (proofread and fixed by me), UI rearranged due to longer text, and updated from .net framework 2.0 to 4.8.

Translated readme:

Usage: Set the test value, then, click the reset button or press enter before each test.

There are two types of tests:

1. Timed testing: Set a time, the number of hits is counted within the set time.

2. Click count testing: Set a number of clicks, the time taken to complete the number of clicks is counted.

Key settings: K1, K2, M1, M2

Use the dropdown menus to change the keybinds.

Features: 

1. Supports double tapping
2. There is a conflict judgment (K1 cannot be pressed at the same time as M1 and the same for K2 and M2. This is consistent with how it is handled in osu!) 
3. Graphs and data display 

	The green line is the overall average bpm.

	The blue line is the average bpm of the last 5 clicks.

4. When only a single key is enabled it will be read at double the BPM. This means it will reflect 1/2 timing (typical jumps) instead of 1/4 timing (typical streams) so you can test your singletap speed.
